What ?
======
This is a Particle Photon library for the Silabs Si7005 temperature/humidity sensor.
The library makes it easy to use the sensor and all of its features.


Why ?
=====
Because I think it's an interesting sensor, and I wanted to test it. I couldn't find
any library or sample code on the internet, so i wrote my own.


Getting started
===============
To be published on Particle Build..

The humidity measurement is dependant on the temperature measurement, and uses the last
measured temperature.
If no temperature measurement is done at all, a default value of 25.0C is used.
